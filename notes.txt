Python is OOP language which implements all OOPS concepts such as inheritance , Encapsulation , Abstraction and Polymorphism.
OOPs isbasically an object oriented programmingparadigm which helps in organizing the code at one place.Instead of revolving around the function and the logic, it focuses ob object.OOPs helps in making the code reusable , modular , clean and easy to maintain.

Class:
Classes provide means of bundling the data and functionaly together. syntax - Class <class_name>:
__init__ is used to give each object its own data , for default configure , for input validation.
syntax - def __init__(self , parameter)
self.data = "data"
self is just the first parameter of the instance method. if we remove self then it will be stored local var and not on the object. If we dont use self we will get typeerror!! 
If we dont use self. then the data is stored as local variable and not on object.. so it dissappears after init.

Function :
block of reusable code that performs same task.
syntax -1. def <function_name>():
            statetement
            function_name()
        2. def <function_name>(para):   // def greet(name):
            statement(para)                 print("Hello! ", name)
            function_name(val)              greet("Revati")
        3. def <fuction_name>(para, para): // def add(a,b)
                return statement                  return a+b
            function_name(para1, para2)       add(4,5)
Object is a blueprint of the class.


Polymorphism - using same method name in different classes , where each class has its own behaviour.
    same method ,different behaviour    
    works across different classes
    makes code flexible and reusable
